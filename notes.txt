 - do the Update/Enter thing
 - transition
 - cumulative sort
 - apply to numeric, categorical, and boolean charts

For transitions, you need a key function eg
  data(d => d.subject, d => d.name)

Nice to display the min & max values overlaid onto bottom & top of at least numeric chart when it's the sort column.  Then think about, if categories are few enough, labeling them when sorted...

where does the g, or the svg, get blown away?
  StripesChart.updateThings()

Where does it get created?
  StripesChart.setContext()

what indexing function can we use which shows sorting without using the y value as the key?  Do we need access to the rank list?
